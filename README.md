# NumberGame
Overview
The Number Game is an interactive and fun game where players guess a randomly generated number within a certain range. The goal is to guess the correct number in as few attempts as possible. The game gives feedback on whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the target number. This can be a great tool for learning and practicing number logic.
